# Third-party Notices

This project includes or adapts portions of the following third-party works.
This notice focuses on vendored code, adapted implementations, model/data
artifacts downloaded by the toolkit, and primary runtime solutions used by the
CLI workflows. Ordinary Python package dependencies keep their license metadata
in their distributed packages.

## WhisperX

- Source: https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX
- Usage: Speech-to-text and word-level alignment for `musetric-transcribe`.

## OpenAI Whisper - mobiuslabsgmbh/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo

- Source: https://huggingface.co/mobiuslabsgmbh/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo
- Usage: base speech-to-text weights behind `musetric-transcribe`. WhisperX loads `large-v3-turbo` through faster-whisper, which downloads this CTranslate2 conversion of `openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo` at runtime.
- Local files: `musetric_toolkit/transcribe_audio/whisperx_runner.py`.
- License: MIT.
- License source: Hugging Face model card metadata.

Upstream is inconsistent about the Whisper license and it is worth knowing: the
https://github.com/openai/whisper repository states that "Whisper's code and
model weights are released under the MIT License", while the
https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo model card declares `apache-2.0`.
This notice follows the source the weights are downloaded from, which declares
MIT. The ONNX re-export used by the `musetric` web runtime is fetched from the
`apache-2.0` model card instead and is documented as Apache-2.0 there.

## OpenAI Whisper - openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo

- Source: https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo, revision `41f01f3fe87f28c78e2fbf8b568835947dd65ed9`.
- Usage: the original weights in torch behind the transcription reference of `musetric-parity`, downloaded at runtime.
- Local files: `musetric_toolkit/parity_audio/transcribe_chain.py`.
- License: Apache-2.0.
- License source: Hugging Face model card metadata.

## Transformers.js

- Source: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js
- Usage: vendored ONNX conversion scripts (`scripts/convert.py`, `scripts/quantize.py`, `scripts/extra/whisper.py`) used to export Whisper to the transformers.js ONNX layout with cross-attention alignment heads. Only the whisper code path is exercised. The transcription reference of `musetric-parity` ports the token timestamps of its Whisper pipeline (`medianFilter`, `dynamic_time_warping`, `_extract_token_timestamps`).
- Local files: `scripts/onnx/whisper/convert.py`, `scripts/onnx/whisper/quantize.py`, `scripts/onnx/whisper/extra/whisper.py`, `musetric_toolkit/parity_audio/transcribe_chain.py`.
- License: Apache-2.0.
- License source: upstream `LICENSE`.

Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use

Local changes, also noted in each file's header: `convert.py` imports `quantize`
as a package-relative module, and the alignment-head table in `extra/whisper.py`
gains a `whisper-large-v3` entry taken from the `openai/whisper-large-v3`
`generation_config.json` (that table carries its own upstream attribution
comment).

## ChordMini

- Source: https://github.com/ptnghia-j/ChordMini
- Usage: vendored inference subset under `musetric_toolkit/chords_audio/chordmini`, plus `2e1d_model_best.pth` checkpoint downloaded at runtime.
- Local files: `musetric_toolkit/chords_audio/chordmini/`, `musetric_toolkit/chords_audio/chordmini_runner.py`, `musetric_toolkit/chords_audio/chordmini_checkpoint.py`.
- License: MIT.
- License source: upstream `LICENSE` and vendored `musetric_toolkit/chords_audio/chordmini/LICENSE`.
- Local vendoring details: see `musetric_toolkit/chords_audio/chordmini/NOTICE.md`.

## CREPE (torchcrepe)

- Source: https://github.com/maxrmorrison/torchcrepe, a PyTorch port of https://github.com/marl/crepe.
- Usage: one of the four models that `musetric-pitch` combines into the reference of the Musetric pitch bench, and a model of `musetric-pitch-zoo`, which checks that reference; not part of any processing step of the app. The `full` weights ship inside the `torchcrepe` package; its salience is decoded with the global Viterbi of `musetric_toolkit/pitch_audio/tracker.py`, because the package's own decoders add random dither of up to one bin (20 cents) and decode each batch apart.
- Local files: `musetric_toolkit/pitch_zoo/crepe_model.py`, `musetric_toolkit/pitch_audio/main.py`.

- Usage: `musetric-pitch-zoo resynth` resynthesizes vocals along a known f0 curve (CheapTrick, D4C and the WORLD synthesizer) to make a ground-truth set, used by `musetric-pitch-zoo`, which checks the pitch reference of the Musetric pitch bench; not part of any processing step of the app.
