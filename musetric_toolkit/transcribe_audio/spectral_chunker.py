"""Spectral chunking of vocal audio for WhisperX.

Before transcription WhisperX splits audio into ``<= chunk_size`` second bins at
pyannote VAD boundaries. On singing those boundaries are unreliable: pyannote
reports "pauses" on momentary dips inside continuous singing, so chunk cuts land
in the middle of a sustained note (which fragments words and hurts decoding).

This module chooses cut points from the audio spectrum instead. Two per-frame
features are derived from a short-time Fourier transform:

* ``energy``   - frame RMS amplitude.
* ``flatness`` - spectral flatness (geometric mean / arithmetic mean of the
  power spectrum in a vocal band). It is near 0 for tonal, harmonic content (a
  sung note) and near 1 for noise-like content (a breath, fricative or silence).

A frame is a good place to cut when it is real silence (low energy) or
noise-like (high flatness, i.e. a breath); a tonal frame is protected and never
used as a cut point, even when it is quiet. Within each chunk-size budget the
cut snaps to the best such point; when a chunk must end inside continuous
singing (no breath/silence in the budget window) the cut falls on the most
breath-like instant (maximum flatness) rather than the quietest one, which on
songs is usually a clean but soft note.

Flatness is a scale-invariant ratio, so the spectrum normalisation that would
corrupt a Whisper log-mel is irrelevant here; a plain ``numpy`` rFFT is used.
