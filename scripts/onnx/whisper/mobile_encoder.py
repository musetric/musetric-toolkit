"""Make the exported Whisper encoder run, and run correctly, on mobile GPUs.

Two independent defects stand between the stock export and a phone, and neither
is in the weights. This applies the three graph rewrites that clear them, in
order, on a single load of the graph, then checks that the result actually is
clear. `stage_whisper.py` runs the same check before it stages anything, so an
encoder that skipped this step cannot reach the publish repo.

**The graph is too big to bind.** Each layer computes attention in one shot, so
its score tensor is `(20, 1500, 1500)` fp32 = 171.7 MiB, while WebGPU only
guarantees 128 MiB per storage binding and several mobile adapters offer exactly
that minimum. The encoder does not run there at all. `block_attention` splits
the queries into blocks and concatenates the per-block outputs, which is exact
because softmax normalizes each query row over the full key axis on its own.

**The graph computes the wrong answer.** On Adreno 600-series adapters the
WebGPU `Transpose` returns a quarter of its output as zeros - silently, with no
NaN and no error. The cause is in the execution provider's shader: it stages the
tile in `array<array<T, tile_size + 1>, tile_size>`, 16 x 17 f32 = 1088 bytes,
and on that hardware a workgroup array whose size is not a multiple of 512 bytes
loses the stores of one warp out of four across `workgroupBarrier`. The stores
land - a thread reads its own slot back correctly - but the other threads do not
see them. `conv_to_matmul` and `transpose_to_gather` route the encoder around
every shape that reaches that shader. The full investigation, including the
one-line fix upstream, is in `plan/ort-webgpu-transpose-adreno660.md`.
